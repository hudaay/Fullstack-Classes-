         <h2> Ingredients </h2>
        <ul>  140g butter softened, plus extra for the tin <br>
             140g caster sugar <br>
             2 large eggs, beaten <br>
             140g self raising flour <br>
             1 tsp baking powder <br>
             2 very ripe bananas, mashed <br>
             50g icing sugar <br>
             handful dried banana chips for decoration <br>
            </ul>



            <div>
                <h2> Method</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li> Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.</li> 
                    <li> Butter a 2lb loaf tin and line the base and sides with baking parchment.</li>
                    <li> Cream 140g softened butter and 140g caster sugar until light and fluffy, then slowly add 2 beaten large eggs with a little of the 140g flour.</li>
                    <li> Fold in the remaining flour, 1 tsp baking powder and 2 mashed bananas.</li>
                    <li> Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and bake for about 50 mins, or until cooked through. <br> <li> Check the loaf at 5-min intervals from around 30-40 mins in the oven by testing it with a skewer (it should be able to be inserted and removed cleanly), <br>
                        as the time may vary depending on the shape of your loaf tin.</li>
                    </li>
                    <li> Cool in the tin for 10 mins, then remove to a wire rack.</li>
                    <li> Mix 50g icing sugar with 2-3 tsp water to make a runny icing.
                    </li>
                    <li> Drizzle the icing across the top of the cake and decorate with a handful of banana chips.</li>
    
                </ol>
